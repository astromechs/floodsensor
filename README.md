Sensor for activating flood protection systems


Problem:

   Our problem is that people are getting stuck, injured or dying from the
human delay in activation of devices that warn people about flooding when they
are driving in a car.  People have to go close gates and turn on other devices
related to flood warning systems. This is also wasteful of time and resources. 
It can be unnecessarily dangerous for the person turning on the devices or
closing gates.  We thought this was a problem that needed to be solved to help
people be warned about floods earlier.

Solution:

   Our solution is to build a sensor that can eliminate human error and save lots
of time and lives. It will operate on the side of the road, and when the water
level rises to a certain point it will activate a switch that will allow
electricity to flow through to some kind of warning system on the other side. 
It shall go about this task by means of a sensor located within a box on the
top of a small pole.
